        <h3>A brief introduction to Merida's history</h3>
        <p>In 1542, Spanish conquerors founded and named the city Mérida after a Spanish city. To build the city, the Spanish
            used many of the carved Maya stones to construct their colonial buildings, including
            many buildings found today in the historic center of the city, including the main cathedral. Limestone is
            predominately white, which gave rise to Mérida's nickname: White City. By the late 19th century, Mérida began
            prospering from the production of henequén, an agave plant species native to
            southern Mexico and Guatemala. Growers became wealthy and built large homes primarily out of the local white
            limestone that still can
            be seen on Mérida's Paseo de Montejo.</p>

            negro" (black padding) which is made with spicy pepper, tomato, epazote and different ingredients based on the recipe.       </p>
